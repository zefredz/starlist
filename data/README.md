I don't remember from where I got those star list. They are probably from the ChView project but don't match the CHV file format <http://members.nova.org/~sol/chview/chvc.htm>. Maybe I have converted them from the CHV files or I have exported them from the gliese catalog... but it was years ago so I don't remember.

I've decided to put those map here so the application is still usable.

If you know from where they are, please send me a message on github so I can add a reference to the source and/or replace them with a link to the original source.
