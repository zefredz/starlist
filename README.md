starlist
========

An old web application framework I wrote years ago used to implement a search engine in lists of nearby stars. I post it here so it will not be lost.

I have included some star lists in order to use it. See data/README.md for more details.

If I have some time to do it, I will add the support for the CHV and gliese catalog file formats and add an interactive search engine.
